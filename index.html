        <h1>Learning to make a computer do your bidding</h1>
        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
            technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take
            command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
            everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
       
            Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
            We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from
            learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
